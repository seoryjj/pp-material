; We auto-grade only react function; other functions are not
; auto-graded. However, S, K, I, v, and a are required for
; grading. See hw4-2-grade.rkt for more information.
; If this statement is omitted, your submission will be graded 0.
(provide react S K I v a)


; Implement react. The contents provided below can be modified,
; unless the modification does not change the type and satisfies the spec.
;
; In the document, react has the type solution -> void.
; However, implement react: solution -> string for ease of grading.
; Return the string of the given solution printed by pprint.
;
; See hw4-2-grade.rkt for more information on what the returned string should look like.
; In short,
; S prints "S";
; K prints "K";
; I prints "I";
; variable x prints "x";
; tuple (E F) prints "(" + E + " " + F + ")".
