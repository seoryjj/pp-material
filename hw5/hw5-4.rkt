; catchYou: graph * int -> (store X real) list

; This task is a challenge, so TAs will test with large input
; cases. Only reasonably efficient algorithm will pass test cases.
;
; Output should be ordered by the stores' name. Note that stores' name
; are one of: 'A, 'B, 'C, 'D, or 'E.
;
; Only stores appeared in the input are considered as the starting
; point, and those only should be output.
